    backward_dynamics!(solver::CLVSolver) :: BackwardDynamics

Solve the CLV problem up to the (final) backward dynamics stage and
return an iterator to step through the backward dynamics.
See also [`forward_dynamics!`](@ref), [`goto!`](@ref).

Note that finishing iteration of the returned iterator does not
finalize all the solver stages (namely, recording to `solver.sol`, if
non-default `backward_dynamics` is used).  In this case,
`solve!(solver)` has to be called after the iteration.

### Example
```julia
angles = [acos(abs(dot(C[:, 1], C[:, 2]))) * 2 / Ï€ for C
          in backward_dynamics!(solver)]
```

"""
    indexed_backward_dynamics!(solver::CLVSolver)
    indexed_backward_dynamics!(stage::BackwardDynamics)

It is equivalent to `zip(some_counter, backward_dynamics!(solver))`
where `some_counter` is an iterator over integers such that the same
indices returned by [`indexed_forward_dynamics!`](@ref) indicate that
those events are at the same time point of the backward and forward
passes.  This is useful when combining matrices [`CLV.G`](@ref) and
[`CLV.C`](@ref) to obtain the CLV in the (original) tangent space.

For such example, see:
[Covariant Lyapunov vectors on the Lorenz attractor](@ref)
in the online manual.

Note that `indexed_backward_dynamics!(solver::CLVSolver)` is
equivalent to
```julia
backward = backward_dynamics!(solver)
indexed_backward_dynamics!(backward)
```
Separately calling [`backward_dynamics!`](@ref) is useful when the
quantities other than [`CLV.G`](@ref) (e.g., [`CLV.R`](@ref)) are
required.
