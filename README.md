The aim of LyapunovExponents.jl is to provide an efficient research
platform for computations related to Lyapunov exponents.  This is
(planned to be) achieved by exposing low-level APIs to Lyapunov
exponents calculation.

At the moment, LyapunovExponents.jl is still at the very early stage
of development and nowhere close to providing a stable API.


## Features

Implemented:

* Lyapunov exponents calculation based on QR decomposition.
* Maximum Lyapunov exponent calculation.
* [Covariant Lyapunov vectors calculation][CLV example].
* Tangent space evolution based on the automatic differentiation tool
  [ForwardDiff.jl].
* Testing utilities for tangent space evolution (Jacobian calculation)
  provided by users.
* Continuous dynamical systems support based on [DifferentialEquations.jl].
  This means that [the rich set of ODE solvers](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/solvers/ode_solve.html)
  can be used.
* [Random ordinary differential equation][RODE] support.
* [Various examples of continuous and discrete dynamical systems.][Examples]
* [OnlineStats.jl] support: on-the-fly calculation of Lyapunov
  exponents, their variance, covariance, and any other statics it
  supports.
* (Experimental) Automatic termination.

Wanted list:

* Delay differential equations.
* Partial differential equations.
* Stochastic dynamical systems.
* Poincar√© map.

## Related works

* [ChaosTools.jl] from the [DynamicalSystems.jl] ecosystem is another
  Julia library which provides easy-to-use, clearly written,
  well-tested, and well-documented Lyapunov exponents calculation.
* [eom] is a Rust library which provides Lyapunov exponents and
  Covariant Lyapunov vectors calculation, on top of configurable
  ODE/PDE solvers.
* (I'm sure there are more...)
