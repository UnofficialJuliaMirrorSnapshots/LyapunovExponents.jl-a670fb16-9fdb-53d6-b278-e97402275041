# Ginelli et al. (2007), Figure 1a

![Ginelli 07 Fig 1a reproduced](Ginelli_2007_Figure_1a.png "Ginelli 07 Fig 1a reproduced")

This is an attempt to reproduce Figure 1a of [Ginelli et al. (2007)].
The following code sets up two problems [`CLVProblem`](@ref) to
compute the covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) of the two-dimensional
maps, the HÃ©non map ([`LyapunovExponents.henon_map`](@ref)) and
the Lozi map ([`LyapunovExponents.lozi_map`](@ref)).

The probability density function of the angles between the two CLVs
are plotted.  See [Ginelli et al. (2007)] for how the shape of this
probability density function is related to hyperbolicity.
